### Tekk Mycelium Maestro

Tekk Mycelium Maestro is an experimental project aimed at practicing and expanding proficiency in Java and AWS cloud services. This project utilizes an array of AWS resources to create a mushroom-related ecosystem.

You will find the full project backlog here: https://trello.com/b/GhjLZMoY/tekk-fungi

#### Description

The Tekk Mycelium Maestro lambda function is designed to interact with a fungal DynamoDB table named Mushroom Manor. When invoked, it performs various operations on the Mushroom Manor table, such as inserting, updating, querying, and deleting mushroom-related data. The function is triggered by events and plays a crucial role in managing the mushroom ecosystem within the Tekk project.

#### Components

- **Boletus Bouncer (API Gateway)**: Provides an entry point for external systems to interact with the Tekk Mycelium Maestro lambda function. It acts as the API Gateway for handling incoming requests.

- **Mycelium Maestro (Lambda Function)**: The heart of the project, the Mycelium Maestro lambda function executes business logic related to mushroom management. It is triggered by events and interacts with the Mushroom Manor DynamoDB table.

#### Usage
